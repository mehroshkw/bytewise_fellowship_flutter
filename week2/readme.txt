flutter firebase project
In my Flutter Firebase project, I leveraged Firebase for the backend. Specifically, I utilized Firebase Authentication for user signup and login.
I then created a class to add data to a Firestore collection and a read class to retrieve that data from Firebase. 
Additionally, I integrated Firebase Storage to enable users to add, update, or delete images. 
finally
I utilized Flutter dependencies and packages for sharing and saving images to the gallery or other applications.
