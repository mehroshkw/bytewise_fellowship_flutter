flutter firebase project
In this project, I used Flutter along with Firebase for the backend. For authentication, I implemented Firebase Auth to enable users to sign up and log in to the app securely.

To store and retrieve data from the Firebase Cloud Firestore, I created a class that could add data to a Firestore collection, and a separate class to read that data from Firestore. This allowed for smooth and efficient data storage and retrieval.

For managing images, I implemented Firebase Storage to add, update, or delete images. This helped with the storage and management of images in the app, providing a reliable and efficient way to store images on the cloud.

Furthermore, I used Flutter dependencies/packages to implement the ability to share and save images to the gallery or other apps. This added an extra layer of functionality and user experience to the app, making it more user-friendly and interactive.
